jekyll-barebone
===================

Jekyll-barebone is a simple scaffold I created for my personal pages. It is powered with Jekyll, Grunt, Bower and is heavily inspired with
Yeoman generator jekyllrb.

Warning : This is an opinionated setup and you might need to modify according to your changes.

I will discuss more of the setup on this documentation.

Installation
============

```
git clone https://github.com/vsbarba/jekyll-barebone.git
```
